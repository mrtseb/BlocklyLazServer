	<h1>BlocksCAD Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>This privacy policy ("Policy"), dated as of August 6, 2015, describes the information we (H3XL, Inc) collect from users of this website ("You" or "Your") and how we use it. By using the BlocksCAD website, You consent to the use of Your personal information as described in this document and accept the Terms and Conditions of Use for this website.</p>
	<p>We value privacy, and are committed to protecting Your privacy. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. As such, we aim to collect a minimum amount of information on You, for the sole purpose of enhancing Your user experience. By not collecting information such as Your name, age, or address, we are not collecting personally identifiable information. The information that You submit to Us will remain private, and we will retain such information until Your account is removed. We will use reasonable and industry-standard efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us that is intended to remain private remains private, such as salting and hashing of passwords. We are incapable of determining any password under any circumstances. By using this website, and in doing so accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use under which You may use this website (see, <a href="TOS.html">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>), You consent to the use of Your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
	<p>The BlocksCAD core software and web site have been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the contracting agent is the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). These are agencies of the United States government. Information that you provide to Us on the site may be shared with DARPA and/or AFRL. This website is hosted by a private entity, and is not owned, operated, or controlled by DARPA or the AFRL. Any data We may share with DARPA will be in the aggregate.</p>
	<p>This Policy and Our security measures are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. You should understand, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
	<p>Your information is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. Einstein's Workshop will not sell, rent, or lease Your personal information to others except as may be otherwise described in this privacy policy without first obtaining Your permission. However, Einstein's Workshop may share Your personal information with third-parties without Your permission to: (1) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (2) comply as necessary with any law, rule, regulation subpoena or court order; (3) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of Einstein's Workshop, DARPA, and AFRL; (4) to protect the personal safety of Einstein's Workshop employees and third parties on Einstein's Workshop property or at Einstein's Workshop events; and, (5) to help enforce this Policy, the Terms of Use, to protect the security of any Einstein's Workshop website or other business interest.</p>
	<h3>Information About All Web Site Visitors</h3>
	<p>We gather general information about all users of this website collectively, such as their computer IP address and the type of browser and operating system they use. This information is not linked to user account information, and is collected separately. We use this information for, among other purposes, site administration, analyzing activity, trends and statistics, fraud and abuse protection, improving Our services, planning website enhancements and measuring overall website effectiveness. We may publicly reveal general, anonymous, aggregated statistical information about this website such as the number of visits and users and what website features they use. For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, We may monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information, change information on this service, or otherwise interfere with operation of this service, are strictly prohibited and will likely result in prohibiting You from use of the service and removal of Your account(s) and associated data without recourse. These unauthorized actions may also be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.</p>
	<p>We may collect aggregate statistics of website visitor characteristics, traffic, and activity. This information is used to assess usage and identify system performance or problem areas. These records may include a variety of data, including IP addresses, unique visits, page views, and referring websites. Cookies may be used to distinguish between summary statistics for users who have been to the site before and those that are visiting the site for the first time. Any such data collected will not be linked to Your account.</p>
	<h3>Information About You Specifically</h3>
	<p>You are always welcome to use the website without registration.

Use of an invalid or otherwise inaccessible email address is permitted, but at Your own risk. If You choose to share Your username and password with others, it is at Your own risk.</p>
	<p>In the event You forget your username and/or password and no longer have access to the email address associated with Your account, You will have permanently lost access to the account. We will not reset any information associated with an account, as there is no way to definitively prove to Us that you are the current rightful owner of said account.</p>
