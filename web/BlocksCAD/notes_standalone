First, make sure you have nodejs and npm installed.

Then, from within the root directory of blockscad, install the necessary nodejs dev stuff by running the command
 npm -d install
Next, build standalone binaries by running
 npm run-script build-standalone

the resulting binaries are in the newly-created build directory.
